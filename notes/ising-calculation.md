# Ising Calculation

After a long time of not knowing where to start I think this might work. We have shown [elsewhere](./fixed_point_algebra.md) that there is a bijection in the field description of the $S$ twisted sector in the folded theory and the unfolded theory at twice the radius. We used this to figure out how the stress tensor acts on the twisted sector as well as what are the primaries, their conformal weights and their characters. Now we will use it to figure out what the action of the Verlinde lines in the unfolded theory is at the twisted sector.

# Double Cover

The double cover of a circle is a circle with twice the radius, and by definition there are two ways to map from the double cover back to the circle which we call $f_{\pm} : \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$. In this section we will show that if we wrap a Verlinde line $L$ around the double cover and then use $f_{\pm}$ to descend to the base circle, depending on the map, we will obtain either $L\otimes 1$ or $1\otimes L$ acting on the twisted Hilbert space.

To calculate the actual action, we will calculate the partition function in the double cover with various insertions of the defect and then do a conformal transformation to the twisted sector, where we will write it in terms of the twisted characters and read off the action of the defects. 

This phase difference would not appear on the torus partition function (most likely) so we need to do it on the annulus. The setup and idea will be almost identical, but in order to calculate it we will obtain the annulus picture using two different pullbacks from the double covered version of it. It's gonna be fun. 

So what combination would help us calculate it? One of the central problems would be to calculate how the boundary state looks like on the double cover. Though that boundary state corresponds to an Ishibashi state corresponding to a spin-0 primary in the twisted sector, so in the double covert it would correspond to an Ishibashi state of an unfolded primary. So the annulus partition function in the unfolded theory is simply going to be multiplied by the action of the defect to the sate. 

It seems like the phase difference between the two lifts will not depend on the defect at all! That's kinda confusing ngl. We can think carefully what happens when this
