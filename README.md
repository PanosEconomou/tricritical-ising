# Tricritical Ising Conformal Defects

We will calculate some of the conformal defects that the tricritical Ising CFT admits in order to identify some stationary points under RG flow. This is a place to store the code needed for the relevant calculations. 



## How do I run this?

You can run this by first creating a local ``python`` virtual environment that will install all the necessary libraries for the Lie algebra calculations.

This assumes that you have python installed in your system. If so, in your terminal go to the directory and type 

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source ./env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And now you should be ready to go! This will create a python environment and fill it with the necessary libraries, without changing your system's installation. 

To run a particular file locate the file and do

```bash
python3 /path/to/file.py
```

That's it!
