# Tricritical Ising Conformal Defects

We will calculate some of the conformal defects that the tricritical Ising CFT admits in order to identify some stationary points under RG flow. This is a place to store the code needed for the relevant calculations. 



## How do I run this?

You need `sage`. To get it [check this out](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html). To run a particular file locate it and do

```bash
sage /path/to/file.py
```

That's it!
